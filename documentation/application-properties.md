## Application Properties

The Application Core accepts a lot of properties for customization & configuration. In this section we will talk about those properties and what is their purpose.
You can check the default properties file [here](../src/main/resources/application.properties.yml).

### Behavior

By default, the CORE application will try to load an application.properties.yml in the root of the project. If hasen't an application file, the core will load the [default properties](../src/main/resources/application.properties.yml).
You can pass an argument in command line to pass a specific application.properties.yml path.
Also, you can pass properties in command line.
The application will **sum** the default properties, your application properties and the command line properties, priority:

    1. Command Line Properties
    2. The Properties File Passed
    3. The Default Properties

**Example: Passing a Properties File Path Argument In Command Line And Access those Properties**

*In Development*

    ts-node src/main/main.ts --properties=/home/abc123/application.properties.yml

*In a Builded Version*

    node dist/src/main/main.js --properties=/home/abc123/application.properties.yml

**Example: Passing Property In Command Line**

    ts-node src/main/main.ts --the-way.server.https.enabled=true

    node dist/src/main/main.js src/main/main.ts --mongo.ip=127.0.0.1 --mongo.port=27018

### Creating a Custom Properties for My Application

By default, all properties that the application uses are within the "path" and you can create properties for your application in the annother application.properties section and access those properties with the property manager.

**Example: The Application Properties With My Custom Properties Section**

*File: application.properties.yml*

    the-way:
    ...
    my-custom-section:
        jango: 1.23.3
        enabled: true
        ports:
            - 8989
            - 9292

*Class: My Main*

    import { Application, TheWayApplication, Inject, PropertiesHandler, PropertyModel} from '@umberware/the-way';

    @Application()
    export class Main extends TheWayApplication {
        @Inject propertiesHandler: PropertiesHandler;

        public start(): void {
            console.log(this.propertiesHandler.getProperties('my-custom-section') as PropertyModel);
        }
    }


### Explaining the Properties and Their Purpose

#### 'the-way'

The TheWay section. In this section you will see all the properties that the framework uses.

### 'the-way.core'

This section represents the properties that the framework will use.

### 'the-way.core.scan'

Relative to the FileHandler(mechanism that import every TheWay component), has the follow properties:

 - path: Represents the path that will be scanned to find the components. *By default src/main*
 - full: When true the path must be the absolute path to the directory that will be scanned. In other case, will be used the process.cwb(). *By default false*
 - enabled: When true will use the others parameters to scan and find components. If false, you need to inject your classes into your main that extends TheWayApplication and is decorated with @Application(). *By default true*
 - includes: The extensions that must be scanned to find components(accepts Javascript Regex)
 - excludes: The directories, files or extensions that must be ignored(accepts Javascript Regex)

### 'the-way.core.log'

Relative to the Logger(An injectable service to log information) has the follow properties:

 - level: Can assume 0 or 1. When 0 will log debug and when 1 only errors and info. *By default 1*
 - date: Will log the date when logging. *By default true*

### 'the-way.core.language'

Represents the language that will be used in the Messages.getMessage. *By default en*

### 'the-way.core.process-exit'

When an error occurs at the boot core and this property is true, the node process will be terminated. *By default, false*

### 'the-way.server'

Represents all the servers configurations in the application.

### 'the-way.server.enabled'

When those properties are true, we will start an express server using others properties present in this section. *By default true*

### 'the-way.server.operations-log'

When true, every REST call will be logged. *By default true*

### 'the-way.server.http'

Represents the http properties. those properties will be used to create a http server with express. Has the follow properties:

 - port: Is the port when the application will run. *By default 9000*
 - enabled: When true will start the Http Server. *By default true*

### 'the-way.server.https'

Represents the https properties. those properties will be used to create a https server with express. Has the follow properties:

- port: Is the port when the application will run. *By default 9001*
- enabled: When true will start the Https Server. *By default false*
- key-path: Is the certificate key path
- cert-path: Is the certificate path

### 'the-way.server.helmet.enabled'

Is an express middleware to increase the security of the server. *By default true*

### 'the-way.server.cors'

those properties are used to enable the cors. Has the follow properties:

 - enabled: Enable the Cors in the server. *By default true*
 - origin: Enable cross-origin over the server. *By default true*

### 'the-way.server.rest'

those properties are used to configure the REST operations of your application. Has the follow properties:

 - path: Is the root path of your REST operations. *By default /api*

   - user-key: Is a key in for cypher the claims in the JWT token. This key is used in aes-256-cbc algorithm

   - token-expiration: Is the token validation when created

   - file: The swagger.json path properties
      - path: Is the path for a swagger.json. The swagger.json is used in the SwaggerUI. *By default swagger.json*
      - full: When true, the `the-way.server.rest.swagger.file.path` must be absolute. *By default false*

### 'the-way.server.file'

those properties are used to configure a file server. Has the follow properties:

 - enabled: Will initialize the file server when true. *By default false*
 - path: Is the base path for your files that will be served in the server. *By default ''*
 - full: When true, the path must be absolute. *By default false*
