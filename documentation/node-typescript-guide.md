## NodeJs With Typescript

The Typescript is basically a Javascript with types and closest to the ECMAscript implementations.

### Before The Way

First you need to install the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). When the NodeJs is installed you can move to the next state.

### Initializing Project: NPM

Create a folder that will be your project or clone a git repository and move to this directory.
Execute the command:

    npm init

With this command a wizard setup will initialize asking things for your project.
When you complete the wizard you can move to the next stage.

### Initializing Project: Typescript

Now we will install the typescript and initialize your project. Execute the follow commands:

*Installing the typescript*

    npm i typescript --save-dev

*Initializing the project with Typescript*

    tsc --init

### TSConfig: Adjustments

To use the TheWay framework we need to add the follow lines in "compilerOptions" in the tsconfig.json

    {
        "compilerOptions": {
        ...
            "outDir": "dist/src/main",
            "experimentalDecorators": true,
            "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
            "strict": true,
            "strictPropertyInitialization": false
        ...
        }
    }

Also, in the tsconfig.json we must change the "target" inside of "compilerOptions" to "ES2017"

    {
        "compilerOptions": {
        ...
            "target": "ES2017"
        ...
        }
    }

*The property "outDir" is the directory that the typescript build will put the final source code.*
*You cam remove all the commented code in this file*

### Main: A First Typescript Class

Now let's code a bit. Create the directory path: `src/main`, and inside of thes directory, create a file named with: `main.ts`.
In the created file put the below code:

*src/main/main.ts*

    export class Main {
        constructor() {
            console.log('Hello World')
        }
    }
    new Main();

Now with file and directory created, you can execute this code but first you need to build. To build and execute, you need to run the fellow commands:

*Building your TS code*

    tsc

*Running the builded code*

    tnode dist/src/main/main.js


With the code above when you run the builded program, an instance of type Main will be created and consoled the information 'Hello World'.


### Initializing Project: The Way

Now with every thing configured and created, you can improve the code with the framework TheWay.
To install the way you need to run the command: `npm install @umberware/the-way`
After the command execution we need to adjust the main.ts that has been created with the follow code:

    import { Application, TheWayApplication } from '@umberware/the-way';

    @Application()
    export class Main extends TheWayApplication {
        public start(): void {
            console.log('Hello World')
        }
    }

**To use the framework, your MAIN class need to be decorated with @Application and must extends the class TheWayApplication.**

After the adjustment let's run the code baby!!!

*Building*

    tsc

*Running*

    node dist/src/main/main.js


Now you are ready to explore all the features in TheWay Framework!

### Extra: Typescript In Development Stage

In the examples above, every change in the code to be executed must be builded and in development stage this behavior can be exhaustive.
With the library `ts-node` we can execute the typescript source code without the build.

*Installing TS-NODE*

    npm install ts-node --save-dev

*Running Typescript Code*

    ts-node src/main/main.ts

### Extra: Watch Code Changes And Automatic RUN

To watch and run the code automatically we need to configure the [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). With this library we can watch the code changes and recompile or run the code automatically.

*Installing the nodemon*

    npm install nodemon --save-dev

*Creating the nodemon.json*
In root path of your project create a file denominated as nodemon.json and put the follow code:

    {
        "watch": ["src", "../the-way/dist"],
        "ext": "ts",
        "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts", "node_modules/**", "src/**/*.js"],
        "exec": "ts-node src/main/main.ts"
    }

*Updating the package.json*

In the `package.json` over the "scripts" you need to add a new instruction:

    {
        "scripts": {
            ...
            "serve": "nodemon --config nodemon.json --watch"
            ...
        }
    }

*Running and Watching the Code*

    npm run serve
