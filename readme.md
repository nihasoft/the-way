# The Way

We built a framework to help you, turning your development more easily and your code more simple!
With this framework you can define REST operations easily and simple, inject classes, configure and destroy automatically classes, override classes to define your behavior, enable or disable some features, and a lot more thinks.
With TheWay, the sky is not the limit!

## Features

With this framework you can elevate the life cycle of the development in Node.js with a lot of features, and the principles are:

 - All in a Core: The [Core](documentation/the-way/core/core.md) will prepare every thing for your application, the life cycle of instances, the instances dependencies, the configurations, the rest operations and a lot more
 - Class Injection & Singleton: With [@Inject](documentation/the-way/core/decorator/core-decorators.md#inject) decorator, will tell to Core to create an instance of the wanted class as a singleton. So, you don't need to instantiate the classes because the Core will resolve it for you
 - Overridden: Some cases we want to create a custom behavior to resolve a certain problem, and thinking about it, the [@Configuration](documentation/the-way/core/decorator/core-decorators.md#configuration) and [@Service](documentation/the-way/core/decorator/core-decorators.md#service) can be used to do this. When you pass as argument a class in these decorators, the injections points will change from the old class to override class
 - REST mapping and concepts more intelligible and concise: With the [Rest Decorators](documentation/the-way/core/decorator/rest-decorators.md), you can create more intelligibility and easily REST operations
 - HTTP and HTTPS automatic server: We use the [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) to build a http and / or https server and you can customize some properties for this server
 - Features On The Way: We use YAML format to provide a lot of properties that can enable some feature or change their behavior

## Installing

This framework is built for NodeJs with Typescript, and you need a project configured to use.

**You can check how to create a NodeJs + Typescript project [here](documentation/guides/node-typescript-guide.md)**

Installing the TheWay:

*For Yarn*

    yarn add @umberware/the-way

*For Npm*

    npm install @umberware/the-way

**Remember to install @types/node as dev dependencies when you are using the typescript with Node**

## Getting Started

In this section we will create a simple application that use this framework.
We will presume that you was installed the node.js, configured to use typescript and installed the packages: `@umberware/the-way` and `@types/node`.

**You can check how to configure Node.js to work with Typescript in this guide: [NodeJs With Typescript](./documentation/guides/node-typescript-guide.md)**

*Main: A file in: src/main/main.ts*

    import { Application, TheWayApplication, Inject, CoreLogger } from '@umberware/the-way';

    @Application()
    export class Main extends TheWayApplication {
        @Inject logger: CoreLogger;

        public start(): void {
            this.logger.info('Hello World');
        }
    }

*Running*

    ts-node src/main/main.ts


**You can check how to build a REST application in this guide: [TheWay: HeroesRest](./documentation/guides/the-way-heroes-rest.md)**

**For more examples or guides, you can access the [The Way Examples Repository](https://github.com/umberware/the-way-examples#readme) or/and [Guides](documentation/index.md#guides)**

## Application Properties

This framework use application properties in [Yaml Format](https://yaml.org/) and has a lot of properties that can be changed for your use. If no application properties is provided, the framework will use the **default** properties.
For more detail, please visit the [Application Properties Documentation](documentation/the-way/core/application-properties.md)
